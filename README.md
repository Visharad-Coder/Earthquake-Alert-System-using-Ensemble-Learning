# Earthquake Alert System Using Ensemble Learning

This project implements an earthquake alert system utilizing ensemble learning techniques for improved accuracy in earthquake detection. Various machine learning algorithms including XGBoost, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting are employed. The dataset used is preprocessed seismic data containing features such as magnitude, depth, latitude, and longitude. Oversampling techniques are applied to address class imbalance. The project includes a stacking ensemble model using logistic regression for combining the predictions of base models. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics and visualized through confusion matrices.
